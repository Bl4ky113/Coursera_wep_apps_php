      Whatever line wrapping that is present in the
      file                                   or lots
      of extra spaces in the file are generally ignored
      and the text is re-wrapped based on the width 
      of browser.

    <p>
      You can add a style like <strong>bold</strong>
      to some text by enclosing it in the <em>appropriate</em>
      tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can even mark some text so that it is a 
      <a href="https://www.wa4e.com/code/html/lists.htm">link to another page</a>.
