## Why PHP
A good bunch of web apps are made with it, so we can make more of them and give support to old apps.

## Tools
Apache server: Simple web server made with C
PHP: web scripting language
SQL: standard Structured Query Language to comunicate with the DBs
Javascript: web dynamic scripting language
jQuery: JS protability layer from the old web days where each browser used a different JS implementation

Up to this point, the course has been HTML, Basic web protocols and easy stuff, soo 
:p
